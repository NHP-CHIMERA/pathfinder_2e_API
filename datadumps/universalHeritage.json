    "heritageName": "Ifrit",
    "heritageDescription": "You descend from fire elementals or bear the mark of the Inner Spheres, and your features illustrate the influence that elemental fire has over you. You gain the ifrit trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You gain resistance to fire equal to half your level (minimum 1), and you treat environmental heat effects as if they were one step less severe (incredible heat becomes extreme, extreme heat becomes severe, and so on). You can choose from ifrit feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat."

    "heritageName": "Dragonblood",
    "heritageDescription": "You’re descended in some way from a dragon. Your physical features might show this outwardly, with a pair of draconic horns, patches of scaly skin, or even a tail, or you might develop an internal reserve of draconic power. You gain the dragonblood trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. Add Draconic to your ancestry’s list of additional languages (allowing you to choose it as a language if your Intelligence modifier is positive). When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. You can choose from dragonblood feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat."
